        <p>Hello, I'm Michael Restrepoross, a 25 year old Full Stack Forward Engineer with a strong foundation in computer science. My fascination with website and video game development from a young age drove me to pursue this field. With a background in cybersecurity, I bring a deep understanding of the importance of secure coding to ensure robust and reliable solutions. I'm now seeking an opportunity to bring my passion and expertise to a dynamic team, where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue learning. I'm particularly drawn to companies that share my commitment to innovation and creativity. I believe that my proficiency in JavaScript, along with my cybersecurity background, allows me to approach coding with security in mind.</p>

        Hello! My name is Christopher Miranda and I am a 27 year old from Yonkers, NY. I got into coding as it was always an interest of mine, but I never took any action on it. As a kid, I had been the <i>troubleshooter</i> in the house for anything computer/internet related. After not finishing college <small>(as I didn't know what I wanted to major in)</small> I worked dead end jobs for a couple of years. I was then introduced to <strong>Pursuit</strong> from a friend of mine and figured it was the best course of action to be where I want in the future.
